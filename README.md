Bnorm
=====

This repo is totally for me to learn parser combinator in Scala.
The codes is based on anorm implementation in Play20 repo, I change the codes as my learning need.

The anorm codes in Play20 repo are really messy, it works but following a very bad coding style.
 
The changes I've made to the anorm codes so far are:
1.add necessary comments
2.changes some bad variable names which make more sense and more intuitive
3.improve the coding style such as using infix notion to replace dot notion.
